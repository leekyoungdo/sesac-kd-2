    <div class="pont">“As I relax on the sofa and gaze around a room a thought hits me: this is exactly the place I’ve been looking for all my life. A little hideaway in some sinkhole somewhere. I’d always thought of it as a secret, imaginary place, and can barely believe that it actually exists.
          I close my eyes and take a breath, and wonder of it all
          settles over me like a gentle cloud.”</div>
